# Marika Finger Blaster
A typing program kinda like monkeytype.com but in your terminal!  
There's only one argument you have to use which is the path to a file containing
the text you want to use.

At the end it shows your:

- Amount of mistakes
- Accuracy.

It even has a mistake history highlighting where were your mistakes.
