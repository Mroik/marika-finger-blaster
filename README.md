# Marika Finger Blaster
A typing program kinda like monkeytype.com but in your terminal! 
There's only one argument you have to use which is the path to a file containing
the text you want to use.

At the end it shows your:
- WPM
- Amount of mistakes
- Accuracy.
It even has a mistake history highlighting where were your mistakes. 
(Sorry for the font of my terminal :P)
